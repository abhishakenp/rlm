/**
 * Fleet runtime — distributed agent execution across the fleet.
 *
 * This module provides the infrastructure for spawning self-contained
 * agent instances on any fleet host or cloud platform. Each agent:
 *
 * - Has its own identity (UUID, host, hardware ID)
 * - Runs in its own working directory (~/<session-dir>)
 * - Has its own Code kernel and RLM loop
 * - Can request files from other fleet members
 * - Can recursively spawn sub-agents on other hosts
 * - Communicates back through the gateway
 *
 * Core runtime adapters (built-in):
 * - LocalRuntime: in-process (existing behavior, default)
 * - SSHRuntime: SSH to a fleet host, run prime-agent --headless
 *
 * Plugin runtimes (loaded from ~/.prime/runtimes/ or dist/plugins/):
 * - CloudflareRuntime: deploy a CF Worker
 * - GitHubActionsRuntime: trigger a GH Actions workflow
 * - Custom runtimes: any .mjs plugin implementing AgentRuntime
 *
 * Usage from RLM:
 *   handle = await rlm("task", host="a2")        # SSH to VPS
 *   handle = await rlm("task", host="cloudflare") # CF Workers (plugin)
 *   handle = await rlm("task")                    # local (existing)
