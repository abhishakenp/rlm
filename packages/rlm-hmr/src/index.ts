/**
 * @rlm/hmr — the reload bridge.
 *
 * The reload engine used to live in cordis-shell.mjs, which is the one file in
 * the process that cannot reload itself. That is not a stylistic complaint: it
 * had two costs the plugin form does not have.
 *
 *   The watch roots were derived once, at boot, from `readdirSync(packages)`.
 *   A package created afterwards was never watched, so the first edit to a
 *   newly added plugin did nothing and looked like a broken reloader.
 *
 *   The reload policy — debounce, ignore rules, what counts as source — was
 *   frozen for the life of the process. Changing how reloading works meant
 *   restarting the thing whose job is to avoid restarts.
 *
 * As a fiber both go away. One recursive watcher over `packages/` sees
 * directories that appear later, so a package added at runtime is watched from
 * the moment it exists. And this file lives under that same tree, so editing
 * the reloader reloads the reloader: the swap disposes these watchers
 * through ctx.effect() and the new module opens its own.
 *
 * Module reload itself is now the official @deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-hmr's
 * job — the same plugin DSH declares in its own base composition. This plugin
 * does the two things that one does not:
 *
 *   It watches the agent's resource directories. Skills, extensions, prompts
 *   and workflows live outside the repo (under ~/.rlm/agent), are not modules,
 *   and so are invisible to a module reloader — but a session reads them at
 *   startup and must re-derive when they change.
 *
 *   It translates. The official plugin announces `hmr/reload` and `hmr/change`;
 *   a live AgentSession listens for `rlm/hmr-reload` and `rlm/resources-changed`.
 *
 * When the official plugin is absent this plugin reloads modules itself:
 *
 *   Under node without --expose-internals there is no module graph to read,
 *   and nothing can be reloaded; that is logged, not hidden.
 *
 *   Under bun — which is how rlm is launched — `bunReload` does it with bun's
 *   own tools: patch-in-place for classes the running session holds, fiber
 *   swap for rows whose restart cannot reach a live session. That was missing
 *   until 2026-09-25: every edit was noticed and then dropped. See
 *   `./bun-reload.ts` for the mechanism and its limits.
 *
 * Running sessions are never interrupted: the chat, its runtime and the
 * SDK's subagents live on the host Surface, not on the rows that draw them, so
 * swapping `renderer`, `print`, `sdk` or `modes` re-attaches instead of ending
 * anything. Rows listed in `config.pinned` are still only patched.
 *
 * Patching changes behaviour, not state an instance already computed. After
 * every patch pass, each live object built by a patched class — every provided
 * service, plus anything opted in with `registerLive(obj)` — gets
 * `obj[Symbol.for("rlm.hmr.patched")]({ paths })` if it defines it, running the
 * new code on the old instance so it can re-derive init-time state with zero
 * downtime (build the new state, swap it in, then tear the old down). The
 * contract is `HMR_PATCHED` in `./bun-reload.ts`; rlm-guard is the first user.
