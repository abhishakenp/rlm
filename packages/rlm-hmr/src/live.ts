/**
 * "Is anybody watching?", asked by the row that would pay for the answer.
 *
 * ## Why this is not an `inject`
 *
 * The first version of the headless row parked expensive rows by naming
 * `rlmLive` in their `inject`, and withholding that token when nobody was
 * watching. It worked, and it had one fault that outweighed everything it
 * bought: **the composition could no longer be reduced.** Delete the headless
 * row from `cordis.yml` and nothing provides `rlmLive` at all, so every row
 * that named it waits for ever — hot reload and the renderer silently off, in
 * a composition that never mentions headlessness. Removing the row turned rlm
 * off instead of returning it to stock, which is backwards: the absence of a
 * policy row has to mean the absence of the policy.
 *
 * So the question is asked at the use site instead. No row present →
 * `ctx.get("rlmHeadless")` is `undefined` → nobody has an opinion → the row
 * does what it always did. That is the same shape `rlm-gitpixel` already uses
 * for its warm index and `rlm-delegate` for its child flags.
 *
 * ## The race the old comment was right about
 *
 * The headless row's header argued that `inject` was the only race-free
 * mechanism available, and for a naive `ctx.get` inside `apply` that is
 * correct. Rows mount concurrently — the loader creates every entry in one
 * `Promise.allSettled` — and cordis refuses to hand out a service whose own
 * fiber is still LOADING: `ReflectService._getImpl` returns nothing unless
 * `impl.fiber.state === ACTIVE`. A row probing during its own `apply` can
 * therefore be told "nobody has an opinion" purely because the headless row
 * has not finished starting, and for `hmr` that answer costs ~1,283 file
 * watches which then have to be closed again. Opening first and asking later
 * wastes exactly what this exists to save.
 *
 * The fix is not to ask earlier. It is to **ask later, but before committing
 * anything.** `ctx.inject(deps, callback)` is not the static `inject`
 * property: it mounts a *child* fiber that parks until its dependencies are
 * satisfied, leaving the calling row ACTIVE throughout. Depend on the loader
 * with `{ await: true }` and that child cannot run until the loader tree has
 * no entry still importing or settling — that is `Loader[Service.check]`,
 * which answers `false` while `getTasks()` is non-empty. By the time the
 * callback runs every row has either reached ACTIVE or failed, so the probe
 * sees the headless row if there is one, and genuinely nothing if there is
 * not.
 *
 * Nothing is opened and then closed. It is not opened — the property `inject`
 * had, without the property that made the composition unreducible.
 *
 * ## Staying answerable afterwards
 *
 * `rlmHeadless.set(false)` is meant to bring hot reload up inside a running
 * rlm, and a probe taken once at boot would have quietly dropped that. So the
 * verdict is re-read whenever cordis announces a change to either name:
 * `rlmLive` moves when the verdict is switched by hand, and `rlmHeadless`
 * itself moves when the row is added to or removed from a running
 * composition. Both arrive as `internal/service`, which is how `rlm-delegate`
 * already re-attaches its prompt fragments.
 */

/** Names whose arrival or departure can change the answer. */
const WATCHED = new Set(["rlmHeadless", "rlmLive"]);

/**
 * The verdict, defaulting to "yes" when nobody is claiming otherwise.
 *
 * The `: true` branch is the whole requirement in one line: a composition with
 * no headless row is a composition where somebody is watching, because that is
 * what rlm did before the row existed.
 *
 * `live` rather than `!on`, and the fallback matters. They are not each
 * other's negation: headless became a fact about a *session* once one process
 * started holding many agents, so a headless worker that is attending one of
 * them is live. `live` is the predicate the headless row itself uses to decide
 * whether to hand out `rlmLive`, so reading it is what keeps the token and
 * this probe from ever disagreeing. `!on` is kept only for an older build of
 * that row that has no `live` — better a slightly stale answer than a crash.

/**
 * Run `open` while somebody is watching, and not before it is known whether
 * anybody is.
 *
 * `open` returns its own disposer, which is called if the verdict later turns
 * the other way. The whole gate is registered through `ctx.effect`, so a hot
 * reload of the calling row takes the listener — and whatever `open` returned
 * — away with it.
 *
 * `row` is only how this announces itself to `explain()`. It is the name a
 * person reads in "not started: …", so it should match the id in `cordis.yml`.
