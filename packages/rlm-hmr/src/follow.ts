/**
 * Hot reload for processes nobody is watching.
 *
 * A headless rlm — the drive sweep, a pool worker, a daemon worker nobody is
 * attached to — does not open rlm-hmr's recursive watcher over `packages/`,
 * because under bun that is ~1,283 file watches per process (see `./live.ts`).
 * Until this existed that meant a headless process ran its boot code for ever.
 * rlm-guard showed what that costs: the protected list was changed and every
 * interactive rlm re-derived it, while a headless sweep kept writing its boot
 * snapshot of `cordis.yml` back over every edit.
 *
 * So a watched process, which already sees every change, writes each debounced
 * batch to one small file, and an unwatched one polls that file — one `stat`
 * every `intervalMs` — and runs the same reload pipeline on what it names.
 * Each process still decides for itself what it has loaded and how to reload
 * it; the file only carries "these paths changed".
 *
 * The limit, stated: a change made while no watched rlm is running is not
 * broadcast. A headless process started after it reads the file fresh anyway;
 * one already running learns it at the next broadcast that names the file, or
 * on restart.
