/**
 * Module hot reload under bun.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * rlm is launched as `bun cordis-shell.mjs`. Both reload engines it had —
 * `@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-hmr` and `rlm-hmr`'s own node path — walk Node's
 * internal ESM `loadCache`, which only exists under `node --expose-internals`.
 * Under bun both were inert: every edit was noticed ("HMR: … changed") and then
 * dropped ("loader.internal unavailable — cannot reload"), so an edit reached a
 * running rlm only through a restart. For a program whose point is to change
 * itself while it runs, that is the property missing.
 *
 * Bun has what is needed, just spelled differently, and both halves were
 * measured before this was written:
 *
 * - `delete require.cache[path]` evicts an ES module, and the next
 *   `import(path)` evaluates the file again. Modules still in the cache are
 *   shared, so evicting only the file that changed keeps every singleton it
 *   imports (theme, settings, loggers) the one the process already has.
 * - `Bun.Transpiler#scanImports` lists a file's static imports with type-only
 *   imports already erased, and `Bun.resolveSync` maps `./x.js` to `./x.ts` the
 *   same way the runtime does. That is the dependency graph the node path reads
 *   out of `loadCache`, built from the files instead.
 *
 * One thing bun does not have: putting a saved entry back into
 * `require.cache` after a failed import does not restore it — the failure is
 * remembered until the file changes. So there is no cache rollback here.
 * Instead a batch is transpiled *before* anything is evicted; a file that does
 * not parse leaves the cache, the fibers and the live objects untouched, and
 * the next save that parses is picked up normally.
 *
 * ## Two ways a change reaches running code
 *
 * **Fiber swap** — the documented mechanism (cordis.yml, "Hot reload,
 * accurately"): evict the changed modules and everything between them and a
 * row's entry, import the entry again, `registry.delete(old)` and
 * `registry.plugin(new, oldFiber._config)`. Used for rows whose swap cannot
 * reach a live session.
 *
 * It cannot be used for every row. Cordis re-runs every fiber that injects a
 * service whose provider changed (`Registry.notify` → `_refresh` → a new
 * epoch), so swapping `config`, `session`, `tools`, `refine` or `agent`
 * restarts `renderer`, and restarting `renderer` calls `InteractiveMode.stop()`
 * and disposes the runtime: the user's session ends. The same is true for
 * `interactive-mode.ts` and `agent-session.ts`, which no row imports
 * statically at all — the renderer `import()`s the interactive graph when it
 * starts, so a swap would not even reach the instance that is on screen.
 *
 * **Patch in place** — for everything a swap would lose or cannot reach: the
 * changed file is imported again, and every class it exports has its methods,
 * getters and static methods copied onto the class object the running process
 * already holds. Live instances look methods up through that prototype, so the
 * next call runs the new code, with the instance's state untouched. Nothing is
 * disposed and nothing restarts.
 *
 * Limits of patching, stated rather than hidden:
 * - Constructor-time state is not re-run. When the new code reads a field the
 *   old class never mentioned, instances built before the reload keep running
 *   the methods they were built with (decided per call, see `guarded`); only
 *   instances created afterwards — or ones that later gain the field — run the
 *   new code. A handler bound in the constructor as an arrow function or with
 *   `.bind` is fixed at construction and never changes.
 * - A module is evaluated again, so its module-level `let`/`Map`/`Set` start
 *   fresh for the new code while the old closures keep theirs.
 * - Plain functions cannot be patched into modules that already imported them.
 *   When a changed file exports functions, the modules that import it are
 *   evaluated again too (up to `importerDepth` levels) so the classes in them —
 *   whose methods call those functions — are patched against the new copy.

 * removed `cordis.yml` from the list was patched into every running process —

 *     `newFields`: it is where fields the new code needs get set up. Other
 *     members start running new code on that instance as soon as it has them.
 *   - Zero downtime is the implementer's job: build the replacement state
